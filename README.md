# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Description:

This repository is dedicated to practicing and solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It serves as a personal playground to explore various algorithms, data structures, and their implementations.

## Purpose:
 * Sharpen your DSA skills through active problem-solving.
 * Document your solutions for reference and learning.
 * Potentially contribute to the open-source community by sharing your solutions.
 for problems categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Each problem will have its own Java file (or language of your choice) to implement the solution.

## Contribution Guidelines:

While this repository is primarily for your personal practice, feel free to contribute and share your solutions with the broader community if you wish. Here are some additional points to consider:
 * Clarity and Comments: Write clear, readable code and include meaningful comments to explain your approach.
 * Time and Space Complexity: Analyze and document the time and space complexity of your solutions for better understanding.
 * Testing: Implement unit tests (preferably) or provide sample inputs and outputs to validate your solutions.
 
## Additional Tips:
 * Version Control: Use Git effectively to track your progress, revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate with others (if applicable).
 * Readability: Format your code consistently and use meaningful variable and function names to improve readability.
 * Learning Resources: Utilize online resources, textbooks, or online courses to deepen your understanding of DSA concepts.

   Enjoy the Learning Journey!
